Current Goal: Change back to non-immutable root for state

Future Goals:
- Change back to Mocha tests and unit test interface
- Travis CI badge?
- Add Flow type notation
- Work out where the trial data is recorded to (Google Sheets?)

================================================================================

Current Goal: Write initial click-n-show reinforcer code

================================================================================

Current Goal: Write tests that prove reinforcer probabilities for conditions

Condition === Setup

choiceas: {
  entities: {
    conditions: {
      [conditionID]: {
        keys: [
          [k1, k2],
          [k3, k4]
        ]
      }
    },
    keys: {
      [keyID]: {
        name,
        probability
      }
    },
    trials: {},
    participant: {}
    test: {}          // GUI test
  }
}

================================================================================

Current Goal:

Figure out initial naming and state structure
- Write probability module using TDD
- Add new route for choice-as screen
- Setup choice components and initial view

- A condition is made up of multiple setups.
- A condition has multiple trials.
- A participant has multiple trials.

choiceas: {
  entities: {
    conditions: [
      conditionID: {
        setups: [],
        trials: []
      }
    ],
    setups: [],
    trial: [],
    participant: [
      trials: []
    ]
  }
}
